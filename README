==============
This is my toy coroutine library. `main.c` is the example, other files are the 
library implementation.

With `make all`, two executables will be generated:
`monolithic_server` demonstrates a single-threaded server, using this library to
handle multiple connections concurrently. Each connection runs as an infinite
loop, echoing received data to the stderr.
`client_threads_server` is just a multi-thread version. Thread pool is used to
handle connections.
